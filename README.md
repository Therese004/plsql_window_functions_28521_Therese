### STEP ONE: PROBLEM DEFINITION
## UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT DATA ANALYSIS
# BUSINESS CONTEXT
THIS WORK FOCUSES ON A UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT MANAGES STUDENT RECORDS,COURSE INFORMATION, AND ENROLLMENT DATA FOR EACH SEMESTER.
# DATA CHALLENGE
STUDENT INFORATION, COURSE DETAILS,AND ENROLLMENT RECORDS ARE STORED IN SEPARATE TABLES.THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE TOP PERFORMING STUDENTS,COMPARE RESULTS FOR EACH SEMESTER AND ANALYZE COURSE ENROLLMENT TRENDS
# EXPECTED OUTCOME
FOR DOING ANALYSIS IS EXPECTED TO IDENTIFY TOP STUDENTS, EVALUATE COURSE ENROLLMENT PATTERNS, AND SUPPORT BETTER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
### STEP TWO: SUCCESS CRITERIA
     1. IDENTIFY TOP_PERFORMING STUDENTS USING RANK() ACCORDING TO THEIR SCORES.
     2. CALCULATE TOTAL SCORES OR CREDITS PER STUDENT USING SUM() OVER().
     3. COMPARE STUDENT PERFORMANCE BETWEEN SEMESTER USING LAG()
     4.DIVIDE STUDENTS INTO PERFORMANCE GROUPS USING NTILE(4).
     5. ANALYZE PERFORMANCE TRENDS USING MOVING AVERAGES WITH AVG() OVER().
### STEP THREE: DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN
     THE DATABASE SCHEMA CONSISTS OF THREE TABLES: STUDENTS, COURSES, AND ENROLLMENTS. THE TABLE OF STUDENTS STORES THE STUDENT PERSONAL INFORMATION WHILE TABLE OF COURSES CONTAINS 
     COURSE DETAILS. THE TABLE OF ENROLLMENT IS WEAK ENTITY DEPENDS ON STUDENTS TABLE AND COURSE TABLE. THIS TABLE STORES THE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, USING PRIMARY KEY AND FOREIGN KEY
     TO MAINTAIN THE RELATIONSHIPS.
### STEP FOUR: SQL JOIN IMPLEMENTATION
## INNER JOIN: 
              THIS QUERY SHOWS STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN COURSES. IT COMBINE DATA FROM STUDENTS, COURSES, AND ENROLLMENTS TABLES TO SEE THE VALID ENROLLMENT RECORDS.
   # INTERPRETATION: IT HELPS UNIVERSITY TO SEE ONLY VALID ENROLLMENT RECORDS. THE DEPARTMENT CAN USE THIS TO SEE THE STUDENT PERFORMANCE FOR THE COURSES THAT HAVE THE VALID STUDENTS.
## LEFT JOIN:
              THIS QUERY SHOWS ALL STUDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE NOT ENROLLED IN ANY COURSE.AND IT HELPS TO KNOW STUDENTS WITHOUT ENROLLMENTS.
# INTERPRETATION: IT HELPS THE UNIVERSITY IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO NEED GUIDANCE OR WHO HAVE NOT CHOSEN COURSES. THIS IS USEFUL FOR ACADEMIC PLANNING AND ADVISING.
## RIGHT JOIN:
              RIGHT JOIN SHOWS ALL COURSES, INCLUDING THAT DON'T HAVE ANY ENROLLED STUDENTS.IT HELPS TO KNOW COURSES WITH LOW OR NO ENROLLMENT.
# INTERPRETATION: THE UNIVERSITY CAN IDENTIFY COURSES WITH ZERO ENROLLMENT. THIS HELPS IN DECIDING WHETHER TO REMOVE ANY COURSES IN THE NEXT SEMESTERS.
## FULL OUTER JOIN:
                   IT SHOWS ALL STUDENTS AND ALL COURSES, EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO ENROLLMENT BETWEEN THEM. IT HELPS TO COMPARE MATCHED AND UNMATCHED RECORDS.
 # INTERPRETATION: IT HELPS THE UNIVERSITY TO SEE WHICH STUDENTS ARE NOT ENROLLED AND WHICH COURSES HAVE NO STUDENTS.THIS GIVES A COMPLETE PICTURE OF ENROLLMENT GAPS.
## SELF JOIN: 
             IT COMPARES WHO HAVE THE SAME AGE. AND ALSO HELPS TO ANALYZE SIMILARITIES AMONG STUDENTS.
# INTERPRETATION:THIS HELPS THE UNIVERSITY TO ANALYSE PATTERNS AMONG STUDENTS, SUCH AS GROUPING OR MENTORING STUDENTS WITH THE SAME AGES.IT IS USEFUL FOR DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS IN ACADEMIC PLANNING.
### STEP FIVE:  WINDOW FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION
## RANKING FUNCTION:
                    THIS QUERY RANKS STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR SCORES USING THE RANK() FUNCTION. IT HELPS TO IDENTIFY TOP_PERFORMING STUDENTS.
## INTERPRETATION: IT HELPS THE UNIVERSITY IDENTIFY THE TOP PERFORMING STUDENTS. FOR THIS QUERY ACADEMIC ADVISORS CAN USE IT TO REWARD HIGH ACHIEVING STUDENTS.
## AGGREGATE WINDOW FUNCTIONS:
                              THIS QUERY CALCULATE THE AVERAGE SCORE FOR EVERY STUDENT USING A WINDOW FUNCTION. IT HELPS TO ANALYZE STUDENT PERFORMANCE TRENDS.
## INTERPRETATION: AGGREGATE HELP THE UNIVERSITY TO TRACK OVERALL STUDENT PERFORMANCE ACROSS COURSES. MANAGEMENT CAN USE THIS TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO MAY NEED EXTRA SUPPORT.
## NAVIGATION FUNCTION: 
                         THIS COMPARE A STUDENT CURRENT SCORE WITH THE PREVIOUS SEMESTER SCORE.
## INTERPRETATION: FOR THIS QUERY IT HELP TRACK WHETHER STUDENTS ARE IMPROVING OVER TIME.THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT CAN USE THIS TO PLAN INTERVENTIONS.
## DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION:
                         THIS QUERY DIVIDES STUDENTS INTO FOUR GROUPS BASED ON THEIR SCORES.
## INTERPRETATION: DISTRIBUTION HELP UNIVERSITYY TO CLASSIFY STUDENTS BY PERFORMANCE LEVEL. THIS IS USEFUL FOR IDENTIFYING TOP STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO MAY NEED HELP.
